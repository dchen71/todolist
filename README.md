##Todo

Originally based on the version of CodeLearn's Shared Todo List but updated and adapted for Rails 4

To do:  
1. Fix deletion to delete based on id  
2. Move and style delete button to float right of todo  
3. Center span4 to the page and make width = to container  
4. Add edit system  

Nice to have:  
1. User/authentification system
